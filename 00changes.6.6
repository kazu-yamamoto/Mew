  case where askp is nil.
	Tadaaki Nagao <abtk>
* Fixing type by Michael Ernst.
* Use the default value handling of completing-read
  On Emacs at least 22.1 and later, completing-read has the 7th argument
  DEF which specifies the default value in case the user input is null.
  Make use of this argument instead of a home-grown logic to check the
  user input later and assign the default value.
  This should allow some elisp packages that replace the completion UI,
  such as Helm and anything.el, to happily make use of given default
  values for their good user experience.
	Tadaaki Nagao <abtk>
* removing duplicated image-type-available-p from auxiliary.el.

* file name change.
* Stop using obsoleted one.
  Using display-buffer-alist instead of special-display-buffer-names and
  special-display-regexps. Using visual-line-mode instead of longlines-mode.
  We need carefuly watch whether or not these changes introduce side-effects.
* Using called-interactively-p instead of interactive-p.
* removing mew-url-regex in mew-lang-jp.
  Why does this duplicated definition exist?
* Fix mew-prog-ssl-arg with stunnel 4
  Currently, variable mew-prog-ssl-arg is ignored when using stunnel 4.
  This makes it difficult to supply extra arguments to stunnel 4.  A
  reason to do so is to work around a stunnel installation that does not
  support FIPS.  This patch corrects the problem.  Ref. [mew-int 3158]

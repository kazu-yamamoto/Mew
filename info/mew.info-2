Address Book
============

Mew provides an address book ("~/Mail/Addrbook). The address book has
2 formats. One specifies expansion rules, while the other defines
personal information.

First, let's look at the format that specifies expansion rules.

     <shortname>: <address1>[, <address2>, <address3>,...]

In this way, you should specify a short name and a full address
separated by `:'. If you want to expand the short name to multiple
addresses, you can delimit them with a comma `,'. (This is exactly
same as addresses delimited by `,' in the To: field, for instance.)  A
space SPC is allowed after the comma `,'. For example:

     pooh:           winnie-the-pooh@example.net
     piglet:         piglet@example.org
     friends:        pooh, piglet



Next, the format to define personal information is shown below:

     <shortname> <address1>[, <address2>, <address3>,...] <nickname> <fullname>

In this way, four elements are separated by SPC. <shortname> is a short
name. <nickname> and <fullname> are the person's nickname and full name,
respectively. (For proper usage of the nickname, please refer to
*Note summary-mode:: and/or *Note draft-mode::.)

The second element is the addresses. If the person has multiple
addresses, delimit them using `,'. SPC is allowed after `,', which
means that it does not function as the delimiter. SPC surrounded by
quotes `"' also has no delimiting function here. For example:

     kazu    kazu@example.org, kazu@example.net    Kazu-kun  "Kazuhiko Yamamoto"

In the personal information format, you can omit any element. When you
want to omit an intermediate element, specify `*'. The following is an
example to define nicknames for addresses.

     *       kazu@example.org, kazu@example.net    Kazu-kun

The nickname is used to replace addresses in Summary mode and to
replace the citation prefix (*Note cite::) in Draft mode.

The comment letters are `;' and `#'. `;' is valid only
when it appears at the beginning of lines, resulting in the disregarding
of the entire line. The comment marker `#' is valid everywhere. The
strings between `#' and the end of the line are ignored. Also,
`\' means a continuous line.



Summary mode includes the feature of directly registering the
information of the current message into Addrbook. To register a
expansion rule, type `C-cC-a'.

     #If you want to register this entry, type 'C-c C-c'.
     #If you want to NOT register this entry, type 'C-c C-q'.
     Shortname: kazu
     Addresses: kazu@example.org
     Comments:

To register personal information, type `C-uC-cC-a'.

     #If you want to register this entry, type C-c C-c.
     #If you want to NOT register this entry, type C-c C-q.
     Shortname: kazu
     Addresses: kazu@example.org
     Nickname:
     Name: Kazuhiko Yamamoto
     Comments:

Add or modify the information if necessary. To register this
information, type `C-cC-c'. To quit the registration, type
`C-cC-q'. You should also refer to *Note Quit::.

If you want to use characters of multiple languages, put the following
onto the beginning of Addrbook.

     #-*-coding:ctext;-*-

Learning addresses
==================

When you send a message, addresses on the To: and Cc: field are
automatically registered. Consider the following:

     To: kazu@example.org

In the case of Address Completion(1) (*Note addr-comp1::): When this
message is sent, a short name "kazu" is automatically registered for
the address "kazu@example.org". If there is already a short name of
"kazu", the next action is decided according to
`mew-addrbook-override-by-newone'. If `nil', the old entry
remains. Otherwise, the new entry overrides the old one. When
expanded, the address book short name has priority over the automatic
short name. Only automatic short names which are not contained in the
address book are valid.

In the case of Address Completion(1) (*Note addr-comp2::): When this
message is sent, the address "kazu@example.org" is automatically
registered.

The limit number of automatic short names is 2000
(`mew-lisp-max-length'). Once the number exceeds 2000, the tail
entries in the alphabetical order are removed. This information is
automatically saved to the file "~/Mail/.mew-alias".

The automatic registration would register unnecessary short names. If
you want to remove these entry, take the following steps. First, type
`M-a' to open "~/Mail/.mew-alias". Then edit it as you do against a
text file. Lastly, type `C-xC-s' to save it. When saving it, the
modifications are automatically reflected to Mew.

The formats of Address Completion (1) and (2) are different. When you
change the value of `mew-use-full-alias' to switch one to the other,
type `Z' once in Summary mode. This converts the format properly.

Address Completion(1)
=====================

As far as Address Completion (2) is concerned, there is an assumption:
user names or short names of expansion rules, personal information and
learned addresses are unique.

For example, consider the following configuration of expansion rules:

     pooh:           winnie-the-pooh@example.net

When you are in a header in Draft mode, working within an address
field, after typing one or more characters, you can complete a short
name for an address by pressing the `TAB' key.

     To: piglet@example.org,
             po`TAB'

If you press the `TAB' key, "pooh" is completed (unless other
candidates exist).

     To: piglet@example.org,
             pooh`TAB'

One more press of the `TAB' key expands the name to
"winnie-the-pooh@example.net".

     To: piglet@example.org,
             winnie-the-pooh@example.net

A string ending with "@" is explicitly expanded. Please pay attention
to the following case where similar short names are defined.

     pooh:           winnie-the-pooh@example.net
     pooh-pooh:      pooh-pooh@example.org

It is obvious that "pooh-" is completed to "pooh-pooh". But if you
input "pooh", Mew cannot tell whether it should be expanded or
completed to "pooh-pooh". Thus, if you want to explicitly complete
"pooh" to "winnie-the-pooh@example.net", insert `@' and type
`TAB'.

     To: pooh@`TAB'

Explicit expansion can be accomplished by `M-C-e' instead of insertion
of `@'.

The explanation above can be applied to learned addresses when
sending.

The format of personal information means that each subsequently
generated address will replace the former one. For example:

     kazu    kazu@example.org, kazu@example.net    Kazu-kun  "Kazuhiko Yamamoto"

Let's watch how it will be converted:

     To: kazu`TAB'

Typing `TAB' after "kazu" generates "kazu@example.org".

     To: kazu@example.org`TAB'

Typing `TAB' after "kazu@example.org" brings about "kazu@example.net".

     To: kazu@example.net`TAB'

Then "kazu@example.org" will appear again if you type `TAB'
after "kazu@example.net". In this way, each address is replaced
one by one.

After deciding an address, you can add its full name.

     To: kazu@example.org`M-TAB'

Like this, typing `M-TAB' replace the address with the following
format.

     To: Kazuhiko Yamamoto <kazu@example.org>



File: mew.info, Node: addr-comp2, Next: send, Prev: addr-comp1, Up: Composing

Address Completion(2)
=====================

As far as Address Completion(2) is concerned, for learned addresses
when sending, the entire addresses are completion targets. For
expansion rules in the address book, short names are completion
targets and unique short names are expanded to corresponding
addresses. For personal information in the address book, short names
are completion targets and unique short names are expanded to their
first addresses.

When you are in a header in Draft mode, working within an address
field, after typing one or more characters, you can complete a short
name or a learned address by pressing the `TAB' key.

Suppose that kazu@example.org is already learned.

     To: ka`TAB'

When you type some characters and press `TAB', its address is
completed:

     To: kazu@example.org

Also suppose that "kazunori@example.jp" is learned. To expand a user
name to "kazu@example.org", you should input "kazu@". To convert it
to "kazunori@example.jp", you need to input "kazun".

For expansion rules and personal information, `TAB' completes short
names first. You can expand a unique short name to corresponding
address with `TAB'.

For example, consider the following configuration of expansion rules:

     pooh:           winnie-the-pooh@example.net

Let's complete "pooh":

     To: po`TAB'

If you press the `TAB' key, "pooh" is completed (unless other
candidates exist).

     To: pooh`TAB'

One more press of the `TAB' key expands the name to
"winnie-the-pooh@example.net".

     To: winnie-the-pooh@example.net

A problem occurs when a short name is not unique. Consider the
following example:

     pooh:           winnie-the-pooh@example.net
     pooh-pooh:      pooh-pooh@example.org

It is obvious that "pooh-" is completed to "pooh-pooh". But if you
input "pooh", Mew cannot tell whether it should be expanded or
completed to "pooh-pooh". Thus, if you want to explicitly complete
"pooh" to "winnie-the-pooh@example.net", type
`M-C-e'. (There is no way to accomplish this with `TAB'.)

     To: pooh`M-C-e'

This example is explicitly expanded as follows:

     To: winnie-the-pooh@example.net

Sending a message
=================

When you are ready to send a message after completing composition,
choose one of the following two commands.

`C-cC-m'
     Compose a message, put it into +queue or +postq, and leave it for
     later sending.
`C-cC-c'
     Compose a message and send it. You receive the prompt: "Really
     send this message? (y or n) ". Type `y' to send it.

Let's look at how a message is modified when sent. Please see the
following example:

     To: pooh
     Subject: the next Sunday
     From: Piglet <piglet@example.org>
     X-Mailer: Mew version 6.7 on Emacs 24.4
     ----
     Would you like to play with me next Sunday?

     // Piglet

This message is modified as follows, for example, if it is put into
+queue or +postq by `C-cC-m'.

     Date: Mon, 13 Mar 2000 19:49:50 +0900 (JST)
     Message-Id: <20000313.194950.59499544.piglet@example.org>
     To: winnie-the-pooh@example.net
     Subject: the next Sunday
     From: Piglet <piglet@example.org>
     X-Mailer: Mew version 6.7 on Emacs 24.4
     Mime-Version: 1.0
     Content-Type: Text/Plain; charset=us-ascii
     Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

     Would you like to play with me in the next Sunday?

     // Piglet

As you can see, Data: and Message-Id: are added. You should note that
both its data type and its character set are guessed correctly and
added.

When composing a message using `C-cC-m' and `C-cC-c', you can make use
of a feature that identifies errors in a header.

Suppose you set `mew-ask-subject' to `t'. If Subject: is
empty, Mew asks you its value. If you want to leave it empty, just type
`RET'. The default value of this variable is `nil'.

Suppose you set `mew-ask-fcc' to `t'. If there is a folder that
doesn't exist, Mew asks you whether or not you want to create it.  If
you want to create it, type `y'. Otherwise, type `n'. If you type `n',
sending is aborted and the cursor returns to the draft. The default
value of this variable is `nil'.

Mew asks you to input your password for sending if the server requires
user authentication. Historically speaking, passwords are not
necessary to send e-mail messages. This is one reason why e-mail
addresses can be faked. In the near future, passwords are always
required for sending messages as are for receiving messages.

There are two ways to send messages waiting in +queue. Please note
that both of these are commands in Summary mode.

`i'
     If `mew-auto-flush-queue' is `t', the messages being held in
     +queue will be sent after the incoming messages have been received.
     This method is appropriate for dial-up environments, since one can save
     on connection fees and repeated authentication for sending.
     `mew-auto-flush-queue' is default to `t'.
`C-cC-c'
     Send messages in +queue. Method is appropriate if you like to
     preview composed messages first in +queue and then send them. If
     `mew-ask-flush-queue' is `t', you are asked, Flush queue? (y or
     n) ". `mew-ask-flush-queue' is default to `nil'.

Signature and citation
======================

Next is the explanation of the commands for processing the text in the
body of the message.

The first one is signature. To insert your signature file
("~/.signature") on the cursor point, type `C-cTAB'. You can define
your own signature file to `mew-signature-file'. Setting
`mew-signature-as-lastpart' and `mew-signature-insert-last', you can
customize the action of `C-cTAB'.

`C-cTAB'
     Insert "~/.signature" on the cursor point.

The next one is citation. If you use `a' or `A' in Summary mode, a
draft for reply is opened up and Emacs is split into three
windows. The top is Summary mode, the middle is Message mode, and the
bottom is Draft mode.

Here are the commands for citing text from Message mode to Draft mode.

`C-cC-y'
     Copy and paste a part of a message from Message mode WITH
     citation prefix and label.
       1. Roughly speaking, it copies the body in Message mode. For
          example, if Text/Plain is displayed, the entire Message mode
          is copied. If Message/Rfc822 is displayed, the body without
          the header is copied.
       2. If you type `C-uC-cC-y', the header is also copied if
          exists.
       3. If an Emacs mark exists, the target is the region between
          the mark and the cursor.
`C-cC-t'
     Copy and paste a part of the message from Message mode WITHOUT
     citation prefix and label.

The default label and prefix is as follows:

     From: SUMIKAWA Munechika <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>
     Subject: Wine
     Date: Wed, 23 Jul 1997 11:40:50 +0900

     > Hi, it's Sumikawa, the guy who's neat from good morning
     > to good night.
     >
     > Talking about the wonderful wine party, I would propose
     > Cabernet Sauvignon, Bordeaux, '90.

In Draft mode, you can cite any text displayed in Message mode. So,
you can cite text from multiple messages easily. Select a message in
Summary mode and display it in Message mode, then cite it in Draft
mode. Please repeat this procedure as you like. Triple windows are
opened for this purpose.


When highlighting gets wrong, type `C-cC-l' to re-highlight both the
header and the body



File: mew.info, Node: mime-comp, Next: charset-guess, Prev: cite, Up: Composing

Composing multipart
===================

Now let's see how to create multipart messages.

When you are writing a message in +draft/1 and type `C-cC-a', the
following lines are inserted at the bottom of the draft.

     ----------------------------- attachments -----------------------------
           Multipart/Mixed                                         1/
          1  Text/Plain(guess)                                       CoverPage*
          2                                                          .
     --------0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9--------------------------------------------

"1/" is a temporary directory to create multipart and provides a
location for "~/Mail/attach/1". The part 1, "CoverPage", refers to the
body. Now the entire draft looks like:

     To: mew-dist
     Subject: This is header
     X-Mailer: Mew version 6.7 on Emacs 24.4
     ----
     This is the body.

     ----------------------------- attachments -----------------------------
           Multipart/Mixed                                         1/
          1  Text/Plain(guess)                                       CoverPage*
          2                                                          .
     --------0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9--------------------------------------------

Here we designate three regions as follows:

   * the region above "----" `header'
   * the region from "----" to "attachments" `body'
   * the region below "attachments" `attachments'

In Draft mode, the key bindings differ according to the region.

To `TAB', for instance, the following functions are assigned:

header
     Completions.
body
     Insert TAB.
attachments
     Do nothing.

To `c', functions are assigned as follows:

header
     Insert c.
body
     Insert c.
attachments
     Copy a file.

The following is a summary of commands in the attachments region.

`C-p'
     Go to the previous file in the current directory.
`C-n'
     Go to the next file in the current directory.
`C-f'
     Go to the first subdirectory.
`C-b'
     Go to the parent directory.
`c'
     Copy a file (possibly via networks) on ".". To copy a remote
     file, use the "/[user@]hostname:/filepath" syntax.
`l'
     Link a file with a symbolic link on ".". If you want to edit the
     attached file, you should `c' instead of `l' so that you do not
     edit the original file.
`d'
     Delete this file or this directory.
`m'
     Create a subdirectory (i.e. multipart) on ".".
`f'
     Open this file into a buffer.
`F'
     Open a new file into a buffer on ".".
`y'
     Link the message which is displayed in Message mode on ".".
`e'
     Input external-body on ".".
`a'
     Sampling voice and insert as audio file on ".".
`p'
     Extract the PGP key for the specified user on ".".
`D'
     Input a description (Content-Description:).
`T'
     Change the data type (Content-Type:).
`t'
     Toggle text and binary for the data type.
`I'
     Specify input coding-system for a Text/* object.
`C'
     Specify output coding-system for a Text/* object.
`P'
     Specify a file name (Content-Disposition:) to save this part in the
     receiver side. If you type just `RET' without any string, its value
     is cleared. Then the file name in the sender side is displayed with
     `*'.

In attachments, data types are guessed by suffix. The currently
supported suffixes are as follows:

     .txt       Text/Plain
     .html      Text/Html
     .xml       Text/Xml
     .rtf       Text/Enriched
     .css       Text/Css
     .sgml      Text/Sgml
     [0-9]+     Message/Rfc822
     .ps        Application/Postscript
     .pdf       Application/Pdf
     .doc       Application/Msword
     .xls       Application/Vnd.Ms-Execl
     .ppt       Application/Vnd.Ms-Powerpoint
     .vsd       Application/Vnd.Visio
     .dat       Application/Ms-Tnef
     .tar|.tar.|.gz|.Z|.taz|.tgz|.bz2?|.lzh|.zip|.bin|.pgp|.gpg|.exe|.dll
                Application/Octet-Stream
     .gif       Image/Gif
     .tiff      Image/Tiff
     .jpe?g     Image/Jpeg
     .png       Image/Png
     .xwd       Image/X-Xwd
     .xbm       Image/X-Xbm
     .xpm       Image/X-Xpm
     .bmp       Image/X-Bmp
     .pcx       Image/X-Pcx
     .tga       Image/X-Tga
     .au        Audio/Basic
     .wav       Audio/X-Wav
     .aif?f     Auido/X-Aiff
     .midi?     Auido/X-Midi
     .mpga|.mp[23]  Audio/X-Mpeg
     .mpe?g     Video/Mpeg
     .mov       Video/Quicktime
     .avi       Video/X-Msvideo

Please choose an appropriate suffix for the file name so that Mew can
guess its data type. If there is no matched suffix, the data type
specified by `mew-content-type' is chosen. Its default value is
Text/Plain.


For instance, if you copy files with `c', the part becomes as follows:

     ----------------------------- attachments -----------------------------
           Multipart/Mixed                                         1/
          1  Text/Plain(guess)                                       CoverPage*
     B    2  Image/Gif                    MagicPoint logo            mgp.gif
     Q    3  Application/Postscript       Presentation Material      ohp.ps
          4                                                          .
     --------0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9--------------------------------------------

Each line of a multipart message consists of

   - marks (Content-Transfer-Encoding:)
   - part number
   - data type (Content-Type:)
   - description (Content-Description:)
   - file name (Content-Disposition:).

You can change data types (Content-Type:) by pressing `T' at any
time. If the data type is either text (Text/Plain) or binary
(Application/Octet-Stream), you can toggle between them using `t'.

Please refer to *Note mark-b-comp:: for explanation on changing the
mark (Content-Transfer-Encoding:). You can also insert descriptions
(Content-Description:) by `D'. This description column is overwritten
when encrypted as described in *Note mark-b-comp::.

Strictly speaking, the fifth column is the copied file name or the
value of Content-Disposition:, namely the file name to which the
receiver saves the part. If Content-Disposition: exists, Mew displays
it. Otherwise, Mew displays the copied file name with `*'
appended. When you copy a file, the file name is specified as
Content-Disposition:. But this is not true for both Message/* and
Multipart/*. To specify Content-Disposition: for Message/*, use
`P'.

Files are treated as singlepart while directories are treated as being
multipart. Therefore you can create very complex multipart MIME
messages in the same way as you would create a file system. Very easy,
isn't it?

The default data type for directories is Multipart/Mixed. Of course,
you can change it by pressing `T'.

Once you are ready to send a multipart message, type `C-cC-m' or
`C-c C-c' to send it as described the previous subsection.

Next is the explanation of the creation of a Message/External-body by
pressing `e'. If the access-type is "ftp" or "anon-ftp", you can take
advantage of remote filename completion due to the existence of the
native Emacs mode of ange-ftp. Of course file completion is available
for the access-type of "local-file".

If you want to abort creating multipart and to get back to singlepart,
type `d' in the top level of the multipart message.

Defining charset
================

Mew has a mechanism for determining the character set of the transfer
form for both singlepart and multipart.

<Singlepart>

When you type `C-cC-m' or `C-cC-c' to compose a message in Draft mode,
Mew decides the character set of the transfer based on the internal
representation of its body. On Bilingual Emacs, US-ASCII is chosen for
7bit character sets while ISO-8859-1 is selected for 8bit character
sets. On Internationalized Emacs, the character set of the transfer
form is chosen based on rules defined by Mew.

<Multipart>

Since the data to be attached as a part of multipart is a file, it is
stored on disk. Therefore, in order to determine its character set for
the transfer form, it is necessary to load the file into an Emacs
buffer converting it into internal representation. After that, Mew
determines the character set of the transfer form for the file by the
same method as singlepart.

On Bilingual Emacs, Mew reads a file as is. So if the file is 7bit,
US-ASCII is chosen. Otherwise ISO-8859-1 is selected.

On Internationalized Emacs, Mew reads a file according to the local
convention (i.e. auto conversion). The command to set a local
convention is `C-x RET l'.

For example, in Japan, ISO-2022-JP, EUC-JP, and Shift_JIS is readily
guessed and stored in buffer as internal representations for
Japanese. Mew chooses ISO-2022-JP as the character set of the transfer
form from the internal representation. That is, even if the character
set of the file is EUC-JP or Shift_JIS, it is automatically converted
into ISO-2022-JP, which is the transfer form for Japanese. This means
that you can attach a file without needing to pay attention to its
character set.

If you want to specify the coding-system of a file to be attached, type
`I'. Let's call the character set "input character set". Also, if
you want to specify the coding-system of the transfer form, use
`C'.

Information regarding the character set is displayed in
parentheses. If the character set of the transfer form is specified
explicitly, it is displayed. Otherwise, if the input character set is
specified, it is displayed with "*". Otherwise, "guess" is displayed.

Let's look at the following example. Since part 1 is a body, it is
stored in an Emacs buffer. Because "guess" is displayed, it is Mew
that determines the character set of the transfer form according to
the rules that Mew defines.

Since iso-8859-1 is specified as the input character set, Mew loads
the file considering that its character set is iso-8859-1, and then
converts it into internal representation. The character set of the
transfer form is decided according to rules defined by Mew.

The input character set in part 3 cannot be identified just from this
example. (But a user certainly knows what it is since he actually
specified it.) In any case, a file will be loaded and be converted
into internal representation, then be converted into EUC-JP which is
specified as the character set of the transfer form.

Handling long lines
===================

For a long period, when you are writing a message, you should fold
each line around 70 characters by yourself. RFC 3676 extended
Text/Plain and defined "flowed" as a value of the "format" parameter.

Thanks to this, long lines can be automatically folded on a sender
side while they can be unfolded on a receiver side. From the point of
user view, you can write long lines casually.

There are two ways to apply the flowed folding.

1) To apply the flowed folding explicitly, type `C-cC-f'.

Then, Mew sees if long lines exist in a draft. If long lines whose
length is over `mew-flowed-fold-threshold' are found, Mew applies
the "flowed" folding. This variable defaults to 78.

`mew-flowed-fold-length' controls the max length of folded lines. Its
initial value is 70.

Folding method is decided according to character set. If the language
is separated by SPC, the new line characters are inserted after
existing SPCs(delsp=no). Otherwise, pairs of SPC and the new line
character are inserted in appropriate positions(delsp=yes).

If you type `C-cC-f' again, the folded lines are unfolded.

2) If `mew-use-format-flowed' is `t', this functionality is
took into account automatically at composing with `C-cC-c' or
`C-cC-m'. Its default value is `nil'.

3) You can toggle the value of `mew-use-format-flowed' by
`C-cC-pC-f'.


Note that folded lines with the "flowed" folding are always unfolded
on viewing regardless of the value of `mew-use-format-flowed'.  If you
feel it is hard to see long lines, use `_' in Summary mode.

If `mew-flowed-auto-wrap' is `t', at visualizing a message, `_' is
automatically executed so as unfolded lines are folded.  The default
value of `mew-flowed-auto-wrap' is `t'.

Replying to a message and deciding recipients
=============================================

As distinguished from the case of a new message, where the writer
specifies the addresses of the To:, Cc: or Newsgroups: fields, in a
reply message addresses are automatically generated.

When `a' and `A' is used in Summary mode, a new draft is prepared in
Draft mode. Values of To:, Cc:, and Newsgroups: are prepared according
to three alists.

  1. If called with `C-u', replying to the sender/poster only. In this
     case, `mew-reply-sender-alist' is used.
  2. If this message is sent by ME, you probably intend to reply with
     the original header. In this case, `mew-reply-fromme-alist' is
     used.
  3. Otherwise, replying to all people listed. In this case,
     `mew-reply-all-alist' is used.

The default value of `mew-reply-sender-alist' is as follows:

     '(("Reply-To:"
        ("To:" "Reply-To:" "From:"))
       (t
        ("To:" "From:")))

This is read as follows:

  1. If Reply-To: exists, copy the values of Reply-To: and From: to
     new To:.
  2. Otherwise, copy the value of From: to To:.

If you would like to reply only to the address on Reply-To: (if any),
set `mew-reply-sender-alist' like this:

     (setq mew-reply-sender-alist
           '(("Reply-To:"
              ("To:" "Reply-To:"))
             (t
              ("To:" "From:"))))

The default value of `mew-reply-fromme-alist' is as follows:

     '((t
        ("To:" "To:")
        ("Cc:" "Cc:")
        ("Newsgroups:" "Newsgroups:"))))

This is read as follows:

  1. Copying the value of To: to new To: and copying the value of Cc:
     to new Cc: and copying the value of Newsgroups: to new
     Newsgroups:.

The default value of `mew-reply-all-alist' is as follows:

     '((("Followup-To:" "poster")
        ("To:" "From:"))
       ("Followup-To:"
        ("Newsgroups:" "Followup-To:" "Newsgroups:"))
       ("Newsgroups:"
        ("Newsgroups:" "Newsgroups:"))
       ("Reply-To:"
        ("To:" "Reply-To:" "From:")
        ("Cc:" "To:" "Cc:" "Apparently-To:"))
       (t
        ("To:" "From:")
        ("Cc:" "To:" "Cc:" "Apparently-To:")))

This is read as follows:

  1. If the value of Followup-To: is "poster", copying the value of
     From: to new To:.
  2. If Followup-To: exists, copying the values of Followup-To: and
     Newsgroups: to new Newsgroups:.
  3. If Newsgroups: exists, copying the value of Newsgroups: to
     Newsgroups:.
  4. If Reply-To: exists, copying the values of Reply-To: and From: to
     new To:. And copying the values of To:, Cc:, and Apparently-To:
     to new Cc:.
  5. Otherwise, copying the value of From: to new To:. And copying the
     values of To:, Cc:, and Apparently-To: to new Cc:.

You may want to set `mew-reply-all-alist' like this:

     (setq mew-reply-all-alist
           '((("Followup-To:" "poster")
              ("To:" "From:"))
             ("Followup-To:"
              ("Newsgroups:" "Followup-To:"))
             ("Newsgroups:"
              ("Newsgroups:" "Newsgroups:"))
             ("Reply-To:"
              ("To:" "Reply-To:"))
             (t
              ("To:" "From:")
              ("Cc:" "To:" "Cc:" "Apparently-To:"))))

If there are multiple entries for a certain address, they are
unified. Addresses ending with ":;", which indicates anonymous
recipients, are automatically removed.

Your addresses are automatically removed. Your addresses are
automatically defined to `mew-mail-address-list' according to, for
example, `mew-config-alist'. If you dislike this value, you can also
explicitly set it like this:

     (setq mew-mail-address-list
            '("^pooh@[a-z]*.example.org$"
              "^pooh@example.net$"
              "^winnie@example.jp$"))

Forwarding messages
===================

To forward messages, type `f' or `F' in Summary mode. Then Draft mode
appears and the messages are already attached in the attachments
region.

Also, you can prepare the attachments region by yourself, then copy
(`c') the messages or make links (`l') to the messages. If the file
names of the messages are numeric ([0-9]+), they are automatically
considered as messages. `y' is very convenient because it make a link
to the message displayed in Message mode.

By default, the entire message is forwarded. If you want to remove
some parts of its header, define
`mew-field-delete-for-forwarding'. The following is an example to
remove "Received:" and "Return-Path:" when forwarded.

     (setq mew-field-delete-for-forwarding '("Received:" "Return-Path:"))



File: mew.info, Node: resend, Next: shortcut, Prev: forward, Up: Composing

Re-sending messages
===================

You may occasionally wish to send messages modifying the header of a
message.

For instance, you may want to send a message with the same body to
multiple receivers independently. Please imagine the case where you
put a created message destined to Pooh in +queue and then you wish to
send an another message to Piglet by copying it and modifying its
header.  Let's call this recycle sending.

Also, you occasionally wish to send a message adding the Resent-To:
field to a target message. This is a kind of forwarding. This is
called header conversion because a message header is modified. The
forwarding described the previous subsection is called encapsulation
because a message is embedded into another new message.

Header mode exists for this reason, modifying a part of the header,
sending/queuing the created message. You can think this is a kind of
Draft mode which prohibits modifications of its body.

The following commands are provided in Summary mode to enter Header
mode.

`W'
     Recycle sending. Enter Header mode in order to modify To:, Cc:,
     From: of a target message. Typical usage is for messages in
     +queue or +postq.
`r'
     Re-sending. Enter Header mode in order to add Resent-To:,
     Resent-Cc:, Resent-From: of a target message. Re-sending may
     confuse receivers, so you should think carefully before using it.

In Header mode, you can make use of completion and circular completion
like in Draft mode. When you are finished inputting the header, send
the message using one of the following commands. You may be concerned
because the body of the message is not displayed in your new
message. But you need not worry, since the body and a part of the
target message is certainly used.

`C-cC-m'
     Compose a message, put it into +queue or +postq, and let it be
     waiting to be sent.
`C-cC-c'
     Compose a message and send it. You are asked, "Really send this
     message?  (y or n) ". Type `y' to send it.

Creating signature or cipher message
====================================

This section explains the method for signing or encrypting "text only"
messages with PGP or S/MIME. The following commands are explained.

`C-cC-s'
     Sign the entire draft. Input your pass-phrase.
`C-cC-e'
     Encrypt the entire draft.
`C-cC-b'
     Sign, and then encrypt the entire draft. Input your pass-phrase.
`C-cC-r'
     Encrypt, and then sign the entire draft. Input your pass-phrase.

To encrypt a message, receivers' public keys are used. On the other
hand, your secret key is used to sign a message, and so you need to
input your pass-phrase when applying the signature. Note that if you
are using the pass-phrase cache or the master password mechanism and
there are pass-phrases presently cached, you do not have to type your
pass-phrase (*Note password::).

These commands create a PGP/MIME message by default. If you want to
use S/MIME, configure as follows:

     (setq mew-draft-privacy-method 'smime)

You can change this variable with `C-cC-pC-m' in Draft mode.

We can consider that these four commands above are shortcut methods of
mark based composing described in the next section.

To sign a message, type `C-cC-s'. When signing, because your secret
key is needed to be decrypted, you may be asked for your pass-phrase
if it is not cached. Created messages are stored in +queue or +postq.

Your secret key is identified in From: address. If From: does not
exist, your default secret key is selected. When you want to specify a
secret key that is not identified the address of From:, type
`C-uC-cC-s'.


To encrypt a message, type `C-cC-e'. A message is encrypted with
public keys identified with the addresses on To: and Cc:. Since this
is encryption only, you are not asked for your pass-phrase. Created
cipher messages are stored in +queue.

This message is encrypted with your public key in addition to those of
the receivers. Therefore you can decrypt created messages. For
example, you can go to +queue by `g' and preview a created message to
reconfirm this.

To sign a draft and then encrypt it, type `C-cC-b'. To encrypt a draft
and then sign it, type `C-cC-r'. In both cases, created messages are
stored in +queue.

It is very likely that you will forget to sign and/or encrypt a draft
even if you intended to do so. To prevent this, Mew provides an
mechanism to automatically sign or encrypt a message when
`C-cC-m' or `C-cC-c' is typed.

If you want to protect privacy of all drafts, set
`mew-protect-privacy-always' to `t' and set
`mew-protect-privacy-always-type' to one of services.

If you want to protect the privacy of drafts when replying encrypted
messages, set `mew-protect-privacy-encrypted' to `t' and set
`mew-protect-privacy-encrypted-type' to one of the services.  This
configuration is preferred to the configuration for all drafts
described above in the case of replying encrypted messages.

The following services are available. The strings enclosed in braces are
the symbols for each service. The service applied when typing
`C-cC-m' or `C-cC-c' is displayed in the mode line.

pgp-signature (PS)
     Sign with PGP
pgp-encryption (PE)
     Encrypt with PGP
pgp-signature-encryption (PSPE)
     Sign then encrypt with PGP
pgp-encryption-signature (PEPS)
     Encrypt then sign with PGP
pgp-signature (SS)
     Sign with S/MIME
pgp-encryption (sE)
     Encrypt with S/MIME
pgp-signature-encryption (SSSE)
     Sign then encrypt with S/MIME
pgp-encryption-signature (SESS)
     Encrypt then sign with S/MIME

The following example works for signing all drafts.

     (setq mew-protect-privacy-always t)
     (setq mew-protect-privacy-always-type 'pgp-signature)

The following example is for encrypting drafts with PGP when replying
encrypted messages.

     (setq mew-protect-privacy-encrypted t)
     (setq mew-protect-privacy-encrypted-type 'pgp-encryption)

In Draft mode, `C-cC-pC-a' toggles
`mew-protect-privacy-always' and `C-cC-pC-e' toggles
`mew-protect-privacy-encrypted'.

You can specify privacy services for the current draft in Draft mode
beforehand so that you do not forget to apply the privacy services
when sending. To set privacy services to the current draft evaluated
when typing `C-cC-m' or `C-cC-c', type `C-cC-pC-d', and then input one
of privacy services listed above. To cancel the current privacy
service, just type `RET' instead of selecting the privacy service.

When you compose a message by `C-cC-c' or `C-cC-m', and if signing
and/or encryption fails, the cursor gets back to the draft. At this
time, the service that you specified is canceled. If you type `C-cC-c'
or `C-cC-m' in this situation, a plain message is created, so please
be careful. After correcting the cause of the failure, if you want the
same service, type `C-cC-pC-d' to specify your service explicitly or
use `C-cC-s', `C-cC-e', etc.


If `mew-use-old-pgp' is set to `t' (the default value is `nil'),
`C-cC-s' and `C-cC-e', etc create old fashioned PGP message instead of
PGP/MIME. If the attachment region exists, an error occurs.

`mew-protect-privacy-*' described above are effective only to
PGP/MIME, not to old PGP. If you want to create old PGP signature with
`C-cC-m' or `C-cC-c' always, set
`mew-protect-privacy-with-old-pgp-signature' to `t'.

For PGP/MIME and S/MIME, Mew supports GnuPG 1.x and 2.0, not 2.1.

Mark based composer
===================

To support PGP/MIME, S/MIME and ZIP, mark based composing is
provided. Remember the previous example.

     ----------------------------- attachments -----------------------------
           Multipart/Mixed                                         1/
          1  Text/Plain(guess)                                       CoverPage*
     B    2  Image/Gif                    MagicPoint logo            mgp.gif
     Q    3  Application/Postscript       Presentation Material      ohp.ps
          4                                                          .
     --------0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9--------------------------------------------

You can find the `B' mark and the `Q' mark at the beginning of the
line. Mew provides you with a new concept of "encoding". Encoding
includes Base64, Quoted-Printable, Gzip64 (Gzip + Base64), signature,
encryption.

At present, 8 marks are prepared.

`" "'
     No encoding. But 8bit text would be encoded.
`B'
     Base64
`Q'
     Quoted-Printable
`G'
     Gzip64 (compressed with gzip then encoded with Base64. This is
     experimental. Do not use this if receivers do not use Mew.)
`PS'
     Sign with PGP
`PE'
     Encrypt with PGP
`SS'
     Sign with S/MIME
`SE'
     Encrypt with S/MIME

Additional key binding for marks in attachments is as follows:

`B'
     Put the `B' mark to encode with Base64.
`Q'
     Put the `Q' mark to encode with Quoted-Printable.
`G'
     Put the `G' mark to encode with Gzip64. This is applicable only
     to Text/Plain and Application/Postscript since compression is not
     effective with other objects. For example, JPEG is already
     compressed.
`S'
     Put the `PS' mark to sign with PGP.
`E'
     Put the `PE' mark to encrypt with PGP. Input decrypters'
     addresses.
`M-s'
     Put the `SS' mark to sign with S/MIME.
`M-e'
     Put the `SE' mark to encrypt with S/MIME. Input decrypters'
     addresses.
`Z'
     Encrypt the part with ZIP immediately. After the encryption, the
     `B' mark appears.
`U'
     Unmark. The original mark appears.

Consider the following example: The second part will be signed with
PGP then encrypted with PGP for "kazu". Don't be alarmed. Its
description is overwritten but saved. The third part will be encoded
with Gzip64.

     ----------------------------- attachments -----------------------------
           Multipart/Mixed                                         1/

     --------0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9--------------------------------------------

After applying marks, type `C-cC-m' or `C-cC-c' to create messages.

PGP key distribution
====================

To distribute a PGP public key, please use `p' on attachments in Draft
mode. It asks whose public key you want to distribute. Just type `RET'
if it is yours. If you want to distribute someone else's key, input
his e-mail address with completion. The PGP public key will
distributed as Content-Type: Application/Pgp-Keys.

If Mew finds that the part is Application/Pgp-keys, it tries to add
the PGP public key onto your PGP public keyring. Remember that Mew is
not responsible for TRUST or VALIDITY. It is YOU who set these
values. Please use the commands described by Mew to set these as
necessary. If you do not know the meaning of TRUST and VALIDITY, you
should learn the web of trust system provided by PGP BEFORE using PGP
to protect your privacy.



File: mew.info, Node: anonymous, Next: Marks, Prev: pgp-key, Up: Composing

Sending messages with anonymous receivers
=========================================

You may occasionally wish to send a message to anonymous receivers.

For instance, please imagine that Pooh is trying to invite multiple
friends to a party. Piglet should reply only to Pooh. However, Piglet
might make a mistake of replying to other people if the addresses of
all the invitees are listed in Cc:. Moreover, Pooh does not want to
disclose the names of those who he invited until the day of the party.

To handle this, Mew makes use of ":;" for anonymous addresses. Please
look at the following example.

     To: party:piglet@example.org,roo@example.org;
     From: Pooh <winnie-the-pooh@example.net>

Here, there is a colon (":") after the explanatory comment
"party". This is followed by some addresses that are delimited by
"," and terminated by ";". If you write addresses in this format, Mew
sends the message to the addresses with them removed form the
header. In this example, Piglet and Roo will receive the following
message.

     To: party:;
     From: Pooh <winnie-the-pooh@example.net>

The receiver knows that the sender is Pooh, but will not know who else
received the message. Also, the string "party:;" is not address, so
the receiver cannot reply to it.

You should understand that enumerating many addresses on To: or Cc: is
basically not a good practice anyway. If you often have the occasion
to send messages a set group of people, you should create a
mailing-list.

Funny marks
***********

Here is a listing of marks that a user can use for insertion or
deletion in Summary mode. This mark is displayed in the beginning of a

left side of date.)

There are six marks at present.

`U'
     The unread mark.
`D'
     The delete mark.
`X'
     The delete mark.
`o'
     The refile mark, that is, to move a message to another folder.
`*'
     The target mark.
`$'
     The mark to save another mark temporarily.

Just putting a mark on to a message does NOT process anything at all.
It is typing `x' that processes the marks including `o', `D', `X'. So,
take it easy to put marks but take care to type `x'.

The marks above are explained in sequence. The marks which Mew inserts
are summarized here as well.

* Menu:

* unread mark::                 Unread `U'

Unread `U'
==========

With the following configuration, messages are marked with the unread
mark `U' when scanning the messages.

     (setq mew-use-unread-mark t)

When you read a message with `SPC', `n', or `p' and etc, the `U' mark
disappears.

These three commands read through messages marked with the `*' mark,
the `U' mark, and non-marked messages. If you type `zSPC', they read
through messages marked with the `*' mark and the `U' mark only. This
is convenient to read through unread messages. Typing `zSPC' again
gets the target messages back.

When you move onto the current message by putting a mark on the
previous message, the `U' mark is deleted. It's sure that you want to
read the current message if you move onto it by `SPC', `n', and
`p'. However, you might not intend to read the current message when
you move onto it by putting a mark. If this is the case, this spec is
inconvenient for you. If you want to retain the unread mark on the
current message when you move onto it by putting a mark on the
previous message, configure as follows:

     (setq mew-delete-unread-mark-by-mark nil)

The followings are summary of commands related to the `U' mark.

`zSPC'
     Toggle the target of `SPC', `n', and `p'. Toggling means change
     one to the other out of "the `U' mark, the `*' mark, and
     non-mark" and "the `U' mark and the `*' mark".
`M-u'
     Put the `U' mark to the current message.

Delete `D' and `X'
==================

If you want to delete a message, type `d' in Summary mode to put the
`D' mark on it. Don't be worried about losing the message by
mistake. Since putting the `D' mark has no immediate effect, it does
not result in a serious mistake. By default, typing `x' moves messages
marked with `D' to a trash.

For local folders, a trash is +trash. For IMAP, it is %trash.

To really delete messages in the trashes, there are two methods:

  1. Type `D' in Summary mode.
  2. Put the `D' mark in the trashes then type `x'.

Exactly speaking, the following rule is applied for local folders.
(`mew-trash-folder' is default to +trash.
`mew-trash-folder-list' is default to `nil'.)

   - If `mew-trash-folder' is `nil', messages marked with
     `D' are deleted.
   - If `mew-trash-folder-list' is defined, messages marked with `D'
     in one of the folders defined in it are deleted. Otherwise, they
     are moved to the trash.
   - If `mew-trash-folder-list' is `nl', messages marked with `D' in
     `mew-trash-folder' are deleted.  Otherwise, they are moved to the
     trash. (This is default.)

For IMAP, the same rule is applied according to both
`mew-imap-trash-folder' and `mew-imap-trash-folder-list'

It is convenient if you can change the `*' mark to the `D' mark since
you can put many the `D' marks at once. To achieve this, use `md'.

Also, typing `Md' put the `D' mark to all duplicated messages
excluding one for each.

There is also another mark, `X', which is like the mark `D'.
Messages marked with `X' are deleted when `x' is typed. The
`X' mark can be put by `M-d'.

`mxM-d' processes messages marked with `X' only. Typing
`mM-d' converts all `*' marks to `X'.


The following is a summary regarding with the `D' mark and the
`X' mark.

`d'
     Put the `D' mark.
`M-d'
     Put the `X' mark.
`md'
     Convert all `*' marks to `D'.
`mM-d'
     Convert all `*' marks to `X'.
`x'
     Process marked messages.
`mxd'
     Process messages marked with `D' only.
`mxM-d'
     Delete messages marked with `X' only.
`D'
     Delete all messages in a trash.
`C-uD'
     Delete all messages in a specified folder.
